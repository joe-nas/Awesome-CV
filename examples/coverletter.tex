\lettersection{About Me}
After completing my civil service duty, I moved from Bochum to the Netherlands to study medical biology in Nijmegen.
I completed my bachelor’s degree and began my master's in medical epigenomics at the Radboud University.
During this time, both in- and outside of university, I focused on developing IT skills such as setting up and managing headless Linux systems, programming with a focus on bioinformatics, web-development, and machine learning.
I honed my data-analysis skills during my master's internships in the Radboud UMC human genetics department, as well as in the comparative genomics group.
Due to financial and personal reasons, I got stuck in a logistics job for many years and did not finish my masters.
A year ago, I quit my logistics job and moved back to Bochum, to focus on extending my tech skills and to find a job which aligns with my passion for IT as well my education.
Apart from my professional goals, I enjoy going to concerts, bouldering, brewing kombucha and most importantly, spending time with my friends and family.
\lettersection{Why working as Data Scientist @ Landeskrebsregister NRW}
While working at Landeskrebsregister NRW, I could combine my passion for IT and data-analysis with my education in medical-biology and bioinformatics.
Furthermore, I could contribute to a field which is close to my heart and meaningful to me, as my family just like many others has been affected by cancer.
At the Landeskrebsregister NRW, I could apply my programming and data-analysis skills, to help to gain insight and document aspects of the data collected.
While I have experience with data-analysis and some knowledge in machine-learning, I could learn more about methods in the field of epidemiology and in particular applied machine-learning.
Moreover, I could work in a team of experts, which would be just as eager as me to learn, share and discuss ideas and approaches to achieve a common goal, helping to improve the quality of life of cancer patients.
\lettersection{Why Me?}
While my career path may not have been straightforward, I have gained a lot of experience along the way, making me the ideal candidate for this position.
I have a solid background in medical biology as well as bioinformatics and during my internships I gained hands on experience with R(Studio), Python and command line tools, in order to analyse and visualize data.
Additionally, I am familiar with documenting work using markup languages like LaTeX or different flavours of markdown.
From hobby projects, I also have experience with web-development, design and usage of RESTful APIs using Python, Java and JavaScript.
I have used Relational Databases as well as document databases like MongoDB.
As an intrinsically motivated person I am eager to learn, to apply and share the skills highlighted in the CV.
While I value being able to work independently, I also appreciate having knowledgeable interdisciplinary peers around, to discuss stubborn problems.
As a hands-on and down-to-earth person, as well as a hard worker, I would be pleased to meet with you soon and join the team at Landeskrebsregister NRW.
